# Terraform with AWS 
## Introduction

![alt text](images/Terraform.png)
Terraform is an open-source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. This repository contains my journey into understanding the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, Terraform, specifically as it pertains to Amazon Web Services (AWS).

In this repo, you will find various Terraform configurations and modules that I have created as I have explored and learned about Terraform and its capabilities. These configurations serve as examples and can be used as reference for your own Terraform projects.

## The Terraform Advantage 😎
The Terraform Advantage 😎
One major advantage of Terraform is that it's cloud agnostic, which means it can manage and provision infrastructure across multiple cloud providers, including AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and more! This gives you the flexibility to choose the best cloud provider for your needs and the ability to easily switch between providers if necessary, without having to learn a new tool or language 🤯.

And that's not all! Terraform's cloud agnosticism also lets you write reusable infrastructure code that can be easily ported between cloud providers 🚀. This means you can manage your infrastructure in a consistent way, no matter where it's deployed. So go ahead, simplify your life and make your infrastructure dreams a reality with Terraform 😎!

## Problems Terraform Solves
🚀 Terraform solves a variety of problems that sysadmins or devops engineers have to go through each day.

💻 Some common problems include:

🏗️ Infrastructure automation: Terraform automates the creation, modification, and deletion of cloud resources by enabling the creation of reusable code to define and manage infrastructure.

☁️ Cloud provider independence: Terraform allows you to define infrastructure using a single language, which can be used across multiple cloud providers, eliminating vendor lock-in and making it easier to manage and maintain resources.

🔁 Consistent infrastructure: Terraform ensures consistency across the infrastructure by enabling users to define infrastructure as code, which can be versioned, tested, and reviewed, just like any other software code.

👥 Collaboration and team-based infrastructure management: Terraform enables collaboration and team-based infrastructure management by providing tools for version control, automated testing, and continuous delivery. This ensures that changes made to infrastructure can be easily tracked, reviewed, and tested before being deployed.

⏱️ Reduced time-to-market: Terraform simplifies the process of infrastructure management, making it faster and easier to provision and update resources. This helps to reduce time-to-market and improve overall agility.
