# Terraform with AWS Readme
## Introduction
Terraform is an open-source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. This repository contains my journey into understanding the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, Terraform, specifically as it pertains to Amazon Web Services (AWS).

In this repo, you will find various Terraform configurations and modules that I have created as I have explored and learned about Terraform and its capabilities. These configurations serve as examples and can be used as reference for your own Terraform projects.

## The Terraform Advantage
One advantage of Terraform is that it is cloud agnostic. This means that it can be used to manage and provision infrastructure across multiple cloud providers, including AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and more. This gives you the flexibility to choose the best cloud provider for your needs and the ability to easily switch between providers if necessary, without having to learn a new tool or language.

This cloud agnosticism also enables you to write reusable infrastructure code that can be easily ported between cloud providers, making it easier to manage your infrastructure in a consistent way, no matter where it is deployed.
