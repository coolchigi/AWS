### ReadMe Goal
---------------------
My goal for this readme is to help others design THEIR cloud resume challenge. I will try to create a roadmap for everyone regardless of your skill level. By that I mean, if you are a newbie to the cloud vs an experienced engineer. I will be putting links to resources you can check out to get a better understanding of the architecture works. My advise is, look through the code samples, if an explanation isn't clear or you dont understand in one go, take a step back. You cant learn everything in a day



### Tech Stack
------------------
- AWS SAM
- DynamoDB
- AWS Lambda
- API Gateway
- JavaScript
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD) using SAM Pipelines(need to figure out the cost of this because SAM creates additional resources for the pipelines)


### Project Description
-----------------
This is the Serverless Resume Website built using the SAM(Serverless Application Model) CLIInfrastructure is defined in `template.yaml` that SAM uses to create, update resources. SAM pipelines are used for setting up a fully automated continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.  You can update the template to add AWS resources through the same deployment process that updates your application code.

Aim to showcases the use of serverless architecture to create a web application for hosting a personal resume. It utilizes AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, AWS CloudFront, AWS DNS, API Gateway, and DynamoDB to create a scalable and cost-effective solution that is easy to deploy and maintain.

At the heart of the architecture is a DynamoDB table that stores visitor count information. A Lambda function written in Python3 is used to interact with the DynamoDB table and retrieve the visitor count. The function is exposed via a REST API created with Amazon API Gateway. Whenever the REST API endpoint is called, it triggers the Lambda function and returns a response back to the user.

The frontend of the website is served by Amazon S3, which is configured to host the website static files. When a user loads the website, a short JavaScript script sends a request to the API Gateway endpoint to retrieve the visitor count data. The response is then displayed in the footer of the webpage. The Lambda function also handles incrementation of the visitor count as each interaction with the website occurs.



## SAM CLI

The Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI) is an extension of the AWS CLI that adds functionality for building and testing Lambda applications. It uses Docker to run your functions in an Amazon Linux environment that matches Lambda. It can also emulate your application's build environment and API.

To use the SAM CLI, you need the following tools.

* SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
* Node.js - [Install Node.js 16](https://nodejs.org/en/), including the NPM package management tool.
* Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)

To build and deploy your application for the first time, run the following in your shell:

```bash
sam init
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

The first command initializes a new application project. The second command will build the source of your application. The third command will package and deploy your application to AWS, with a series of prompts. Follow the prompts


### **Use the SAM CLI to build and test locally**

Build your application with the `sam build` command.

```bash
serverless-resume-website$ sam build
```

Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives from the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in this project.

Run functions locally and invoke them with the `sam local invoke` command.

```bash
serverless-resume-website$ sam local invoke {functionName} --event events/event.json
```

The SAM CLI reads the application template to determine the API's routes and the functions that they invoke. The `Events` property on each function's definition includes the route and method for each path.

```yaml
      Events:
        HelloWorld:
          Type: Api
          Properties:
            Path: /counter
            Method: get
```

### **Add a resource to your application**
The application template uses AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to define application resources. AWS SAM is an extension of AWS CloudFormation with a simpler syntax for configuring common serverless application resources such as functions, triggers, and APIs. For resources not included in [the SAM specification](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md), you can use standard [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) resource types.

### **Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs**

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs generated by your deployed Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

`NOTE`: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not just the ones you deploy using SAM.

```bash
serverless-resume-website$ sam logs -n ResumeViewCountFunction --stack-name serverless-resume-web-app --tail
```

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [SAM CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).


### **Cleanup**

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name serverless-resume-website
```

## Resources

See the [AWS SAM developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html) for an introduction to SAM specification, the SAM CLI, and serverless application concepts.

[SAM Workshop](https://catalog.workshops.aws/complete-aws-sam/en-US) This is truly a gold mine that is often overlooked. The AWS workshops are next level, and I highly recommend them. I followed the workshop and customized my function to display the time based on the user's entered time zone. It truly helped me to better understand the concept 

Next, you can use AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy ready to use Apps that go beyond hello world samples and learn how authors developed their applications: [AWS Serverless Application Repository main page](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/)


## DynamoDB
----------------------------
Here's my table definition, you can use:
```yaml
CounterTable:
    Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
    Properties:
      TableName: visitorsCountTable
      AttributeDefinitions:
        - AttributeName: "ID"
          AttributeType: "S"
      KeySchema:
        - AttributeName: "ID"
          KeyType: "HASH"
      BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST
```
What does it do?
- Defines CloudFormation stack resource called CounterTable which is a DynamoDB table with the table name visitorsCountTable
- Table has one attribute called ID with data type String (denoted by "S") and it is the partition key for the table (denoted by HASH)
- The BillingMode is set to PAY_PER_REQUEST, which means that the requester pays for the provisioned and consumed read and write activity.

That's right, nothing too fancy. And that's the power of designing infrastructure as code using SAM. I encountered an error with the key schema and after minutes of research (AKA Googling), I was able to figure it out by simply changing one line. The best part was SAM doesn't deploy until the resources are good to go! Thank you, SAM, for saving my sanity

## Lambda Function
----------------------------------
I created two separate Lambda functions for my project: one that retrieves the counter value from the DynamoDB table and another that updates the counter. You may be wondering why I took this approach. The reason is that Lambda functions are typically used for event-driven architectures, and designing a single function to handle all requests might seem like a straightforward solution. However, there are tradeoffs to consider. If the system experiences a high volume of both get and update requests, having a single Lambda function could lead to performance issues. This is because both types of requests would be competing for the same resources, potentially causing slower response times and bottlenecks in the system. By using two separate Lambda functions, we can mitigate this issue and achieve better performance overall

From a microservice approach, having two separate Lambda functions can provide several benefits. First, it allows for separation of concerns, where each function is responsible for a specific task, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain the code. This can also help to minimize the impact of changes to one function on other functions.

In the case of the counter example, having a separate Lambda function to retrieve the counter value from the DynamoDB table and another to update the counter allows for a more modular design. Each function can be developed and deployed independently, and changes made to one function do not necessarily affect the other.

### Get Function
Before deploying your application with SAM, make sure to test it locally. 

To test your individual functions use the command:

```bash
sam local invoke {functionName}
```

To test the API, use the command:
```bash
sam local start-api
```
- When you run the start-api, you'll get a route you can perform http calls on using Postman or whatever API test service of your choice.
- start-api finds any functions within your AWS SAM template that have HttpApi or Api event sources defined. Then, it mounts the function at the defined HTTP paths.

[start-api docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-using-start-api.html)

There are a couple of ways to make SAM detect changes in your Lambda function code. One is to delete the .aws-sam folder and run `sam local start-api` again, which will force SAM to hot-load the updated function code. Another way is to build the Lambda function with the updates and then deploy the API locally, which will also make SAM detect the changes.

[Discussion on this issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66713446/how-to-force-aws-sam-cli-to-detect-changes)

To build just the lambda function:

```bash
sam local invoke {functionName}
# Then
sam local start-api
```
```py
def lambda_handler(event, context):
        response = table.get_item(Key={'ID': 'viewCount'})
        if "Item" in response:
                view_count = response['Item']['viewCount']
        print(view_count)
        return {
            "statusCode": 200,
                "headers": {
                        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
                        "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "*",
                        "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": "*",
                        "Content-Type": "application/json",
                        "Access-Control-Expose-Headers": "*"
  },
  "body": view_count
}
```
This Python function serves as the handler for our Lambda function. When triggered, the Lambda function retrieves the item with the 'ID' of 'viewCount' from a DynamoDB table. The 'view_count' variable is then assigned the value of the 'count' attribute of the retrieved item. The function then constructs and returns an HTTP response with a status code of 200 and a JSON-encoded body containing the value of 'view_count'. 

### Put Function
```py
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    response = table.update_item(
        Key={'ID': 'viewCount'},
        UpdateExpression='ADD #viewCount :incr',
        ExpressionAttributeNames={'#viewCount': 'viewCount'},
        ExpressionAttributeValues={':incr': 1},
        ReturnValues='UPDATED_NEW'
    )
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'headers': {
            'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
            'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': '*',
            'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials': '*',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
    }

The update is performed using the 'update_item' function, which uses an UpdateExpression to add a value to an existing attribute in the item. The attribute is specified by the 'Key' variable and the value to be added is specified by the 'ExpressionAttributeValues' variable.

The function returns an HTTP 200 status code and some headers, including the 'Content-Type' header which specifies that the response is in JSON format. This indicates that the Lambda function is intended to be used as part of a web service that returns JSON data.
```


##  API Gateway
I wish I had taken the time to understand this when I first created the project; it would have been tremendously helpful. Instead, I watched a couple of videos at 1.5x speed (deep sigh) and thought I had understood it. Guess what? I was wrong!

API Gateway carries this project because it acts as a *front door* for HTTP requests to access backend services like your Lambda functions. API Gateway enables the user to trigger those functions via HTTP endpoints. When an HTTP request is made to an API Gateway endpoint, it can pass the request to a Lambda function, which can then process the request and return a response.

## Javascript
Javascript can be used in the front-end of the Cloud Resume Challenge website to retrieve and display the counter stored in the DynamoDB table. Here are two ways and the drawbacks:

<ol>
<li>
Directly accessing the DynamoDB table: JavaScript can directly access the DynamoDB table by using the AWS SDK for JavaScript. Here's an example code snippet that retrieves the counter value from the 'viewCount' item in the 'visitorsCounter' table:

```js
var AWS = require('aws-sdk');
var dynamodb = new AWS.DynamoDB();

dynamodb.getItem({
  TableName: 'visitorsCounter',
  Key: {
    'ID': {
      S: 'viewCount'
    }
  }
}, function (err, data) {
  if (err) console.log(err);
  else console.log(data.Item.count.N);
});

```
</li>
<li> <i>pick me</i> Using an API Gateway endpoint with a Lambda function:
JavaScript can also retrieve the counter value from the DynamoDB table using an API Gateway endpoint with a Lambda function. Here's an example code snippet that sends a GET request to the API Gateway endpoint:

```js
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("GET", "https://example.com/my-api-gateway-endpoint", true);
xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");

xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
  if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) {
    var data = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
    console.log(data.count);
  }
};

xhr.send();
```
In this case, the API Gateway endpoint is backed by a Lambda function that retrieves the counter value from the DynamoDB table and returns it as a JSON response to the client.  Provides a layer of abstraction between the client-side JavaScript code and the database
</li>
</ol>

  Drawbacks of the first option:
  - Scalability concerns: If you have a large number of users accessing the DynamoDB table directly from JavaScript, it can put a strain on your database and affect its scalability.

  - Maintainability concerns: As your application grows, it can become difficult to manage the code that directly accesses the database. This can lead to code that is difficult to maintain and update.

SAM Local Invoke
-------------------------
Run and test your SAM Application locally before pushing your code to your central repo.

To fully understand how SAM works, I will advise following this workshop

https://catalog.workshops.aws/complete-aws-sam/en-US/module-2-local/


### Challenges-Closing
----------
Ah, the joys of trial and error. The biggest challenge I faced was trying to figure out how to use SAM, but who needs documentation when you have sheer determination and a sense of adventure, am I right? (Insert eyeroll here). In all seriousness, I learned the hard way that it's always better to take advantage of the great resources provided by AWS, like their comprehensive documentation, instead of reinventing the wheel. Lesson learned!

Starting a project from scratch can be exciting, but it can also be stressful. Want to avoid headaches and save time? Create an architectural diagram. It gives a bird's-eye view of your project, helps you understand the why and how of each service, and ensures everything is interconnected properly. Think of it as a magic wand that solves 60% of your problems. And remember, always embrace the micro-service approach - it's the secret sauce to building great things! Now go forth and architect away üèóÔ∏è
