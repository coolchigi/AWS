          ~ I am currently a third-year Computer Science student at Carleton
          University üéì, based in Ottawa. As a skilled full-stack and cloud
          engineer, I have a passion for exploring different technologies and a
          willingness to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2022, I decided to delve into the realm of cloud computing by
          obtaining AWS certifications. This was a significant departure from my
          previous experiences, but it proved to be a rewarding decision. I was
          fortunate to secure an internship as a Cloud Solutions Intern at
          SurveyMonkey, where I expanded my knowledge of Kubernetes and
          Terraform under the mentorship of seasoned professionals.
        </p>
        <p>
          ~ Despite the high barrier to entry in cloud computing, especially for
          students, my curiosity drove me to overcome these challenges. With a
          wealth of experience in leveraging AWS cloud infrastructure, I am
          eager to apply my skills to develop innovative solutionsüí°.
        </p>
        <p>
          My interests lie in cloud computing, designing scalable systems,
          full-stack development, and backend development. I look forward to
          continuing my journey in the tech industry and making meaningful
          contributions to the field ~
